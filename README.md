plugins Angel recommends if you have access to a daw that can actually load vst/au:

• Fabfilter!!!
• STOCK PLUGINS — simple and limitless)
• Valhalla plugins — cool
• Reason Rack — kinda cool (in) both effects and instrument-wise
• WAVES — goated for vocal chains + mastering

These ones depend on the genre / style:
• Ample vsts — good when correctly used
• Swam — REALLY good for orchestral 
• Spire — goat (most popular vst)
• Serum 2
• Kontakt + factory libraries 1 & 2
• Korg m1
• Purity — neat sound selection i use it sometimes for cute digi beats :3
• Wavestation — depends on the user tbh but i find it useful for _pads_
• Xpand!2 — goated sound selection & it goes on sale often (hehe🦧)
• Sylenth1 — cool, Snailshouse uses it for everything so i like it

 • U-HE Diva — really good, but memory draining. emulates old sounds, kinda
 • (All) U he plugins — goated
• Soundfonts are cool (Underappreciated)
 ○ oftenly made myself
  ● Different ways to do it:

A) download directly --> https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts?formats=sf2&tags=soundfont
B) rip sounds from games (sampling)
C) turn wav files into sf2 by using polyphone
